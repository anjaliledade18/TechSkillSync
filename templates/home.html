        <p>

        <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
            We are building a website designed to assist individuals aspiring to enter the IT industry by matching their current skill set to relevant job opportunities while identifying skill gaps.
            The platform allows users to input their skills and receive a list of IT jobs that align with their expertise, along with any missing skills needed for their desired roles.
            Alternatively, users can enter a specific job title to retrieve the relevant skill set, helping them understand the competencies required.
        </p>

        <p>
            Key features include integrated job listings linking to online advertisements, advanced job filtering, and a CV skill extraction tool to identify extracted skills and gaps.
            The platform uses both ESCO and the Australian skills taxonomy to ensure structured and comprehensive skill mapping.
